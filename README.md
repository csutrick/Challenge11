# Challenge 11

## Description

This website is made to help you track your daily lives as a note app/website. Simply just name your notes with titles and add whatver contents that you want. This assignment was kinda tricky for me as a struggled somewhat with the routes, however looking at the class folder really helped me out. Heroku was also something new where I faced a few challenges.

## Installation

Follow these steps to launch the website
1. npm install
2. launch "server.js" file through node (command is"node server.js")
3. cmd click on the PORT link in the terminal

## Usage

The website is pretty simple as you just have to enter a title and its contents and then press the little save button in the top right hand corner, this saves it to the database. Now if you check db/db.json you should see your note contents in the file. I didnt finish the delete button but for future devolpment i would like to add that feature as i feel its missing that important feature.
